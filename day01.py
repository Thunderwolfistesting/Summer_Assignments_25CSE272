# 1. Write a program to Calculate sum of first N natural numbers.
num = int(input("Enter the number: "))  # taking input. 
sum_val = 0  # initializing variable name as zero

for i in range(1, num + 1):  # for loop--> N
    sum_val += i  # adding all the numbers
print(f"The Sum is {sum_val}")  # printing sum


# 2. Write a program to Print multiplication table of a given number.
num = int(input("Enter the number: "))  # taking input 

for i in range(1, 11):  # loop iteration
    print(f"{num} X {i} = {num * i}") 
    # multiplying number entered by the user to the values which our loop is iterating to.


# 3. Write a program to Find factorial of a number.
num = int(input("Enter the number: "))  # taking input from user
factorial = 1  # initializing factorial variable as 1

for i in range(1, num + 1):
    factorial *= i

print(f"The Factorial of {num} is {factorial}.")


# 4. Write a program to Count digits in a number.
num = int(input("Enter the number: "))  # taking input from user
count = 0  # initializing count --> zero
temp = num  # storing original value in temp

while num != 0:  # loop running until the num becomes zero
    d = num % 10  # extracting every digit
    count += 1  # increase count by 1 for every digit
    num = num // 10  # excluding the digit that we have got
print(f"The number of digits in {temp} is {count}")  # printing count
